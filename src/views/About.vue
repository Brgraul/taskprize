          Smart Contracts are one of the most powerful applications of
          Blockchain technology. Once designed, coded and implemented on the
          Blockchain, they are automatically executed whenever predefined
          trigger-events occur. Through clever design and strict rule-based
          execution of these contracts, it is possible to induce actors to act
          justly, without middlemen like banks, governments or notaries.
